These bills, HB 2160 and SB 6024, propose mandating cities to permit developments of a specific scale within certain distances from high-capacity transit stops. This study evaluates the extent to which the proposed increases in development capacity under these bills exceed current allowances. The findings indicate a substantial enhancement in development potential for the majority of areas within walking distance of transit stops. Specifically, for land that is developable and presently zoned for lower development capacity than what the bills propose, the average increase in capacity is projected to be +1.35 in terms of floor area ratio (FAR).\n \nplain-language-summary: |\n  In 2024, the Washington State Legislature considered two new laws aimed at making it easier to build homes near public transit areas, like light rail stations and bus rapid transit stops. These laws would require cities to allow taller, denser buildings in these areas. Our study looked at how much more development could happen under these new laws compared to what's currently allowed. We found that, if these laws pass, there would be a lot more room for building new homes and apartments near transit stops.\nkey-points:\n  - \"Washington State Legislature's HB 2160 and SB 6024 (2024 legislative session) would substantially increase development capacity for most of the land within walking distance of high-capacity transit stops\"\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Futurewise\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(scales)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nhere() starts at C:/Users/tiern/Documents/R/2024-transit-oriented-development-bill\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npugetsound_pop_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/pugetsound_pop_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n\noutside_pop_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/outside_pop_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n\npugetsound_hu_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/pugetsound_hu_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n\noutside_hu_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/outside_hu_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## About Futurewise {.unnumbered}\n\n[![](images/Futurewise Logo.png){style=\"float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\" fig-alt=\"Futurewise logo\" fig-align=\"left\" width=\"150\"}](https://futurewise.org/)\n\nFuturewise is a nonprofit organization that works throughout Washington State on the implementation of the Growth Management Act (GMA).

Between 2010 and 2023, the central Puget Sound's four-county region (King, Snohomish, Pierce, and Kitsap) added more residents and housing units than the rest of Washington state combined.[^1]\n\n[^1]: The source of these statistics are the author's analysis of postcensial estimates by the Washington State Office of Financial Management. The central Puget Sound population grew by 414,400 people between 2010 and 2023, while the rest of the state's population grew by 84,300 people. During the same period, 276,177 housing units were added in the this region, while 179,786 units were created elsewhere in the state.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Results\n\n## Discussion\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n",
