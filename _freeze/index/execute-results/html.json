These bills, House Bill 2160 and Senate Bill 6024, proposed mandating cities to allow developments of a specific scale within certain distances from high-capacity transit stops. This study evaluates the extent to which the proposed increases in development capacity under these bills exceed current allowances. The findings indicate a substantial increase in development potential for the majority of areas within walking distance of transit stops. Specifically, for land that is developable and zoned for lower development capacity than what the bills propose, the average increase in capacity is projected to be an additional 1.35 floor area ratio (FAR).\n \nplain-language-summary: |\n  In 2024, the Washington State Legislature considered two new laws aimed at making it easier to build homes near public transit areas, like light rail stations and bus rapid transit stops. These laws would require cities to allow taller, denser buildings in these areas. Our study looked at how much more development could happen under these new laws compared to what's currently allowed. We found that, if these laws pass, there would be a lot more room for building new homes and apartments near transit stops.\nkey-points:\n  - \"Washington State Legislature's HB 2160 and SB 6024 (2024 legislative session) would substantially increase development capacity for most of the land within walking distance of high-capacity transit stops\"\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Futurewise\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(scales)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nhere() starts at C:/Users/tiern/Documents/R/2024-transit-oriented-development-bill\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npugetsound_pop_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/pugetsound_pop_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n\noutside_pop_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/outside_pop_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n\npugetsound_hu_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/pugetsound_hu_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n\noutside_hu_growth_2010_2023 <- readRDS(here(\"data_outputs/outside_hu_growth_2010_2023.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## About Futurewise {.unnumbered}\n\n[![](images/Futurewise%20Logo.png){style=\"float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\" fig-alt=\"Futurewise logo\" fig-align=\"left\" width=\"150\"}](https://futurewise.org/)\n\nFuturewise is a nonprofit organization that works throughout Washington State on the implementation of the Growth Management Act (GMA).

Between 2010 and 2023, the central Puget Sound's four-county region (King, Snohomish, Pierce, and Kitsap counties) added more residents and housing units than the rest of Washington state combined.[^1] According to forecasts by the Puget Sound Regional Council, the region's population is expected to grow to 5.8 million people living within 2.8 million households by 2050.[@pugetsoundregionalcouncil2018]\n\n[^1]: The source of these statistics are the author's analysis of postcensial estimates by the Washington State Office of Financial Management. The central Puget Sound population grew by 414,400 people between 2010 and 2023, while the rest of the state's population grew by 84,300 people. During the same period, 276,177 housing units were added in the this region, while 179,786 units were created elsewhere in the state.\n\nOne challenge that the central Puget Sound region faces is high, rising housing costs. The Puget Sound Regional Council's *Housing Stability Strategy: 2023 Monitoring Report* provides several sobering statistics about the region's housing costs. According to the report, during the decade between 2010 and 2020, the region added only one housing unit for every three new people that were born or moved there. By 2023, the annual income required to purchase the area's median priced home was \\$160,000.[^2] Between July 2015 and July 2023, the median rent cost increased by 50%.[@pugetsoundregionalcouncil2023]\n\n[^2]: This estimate includes three of the four central Puget Sound counties: King, Pierce, and Snohomish.\n\n### Transit-Oriented Development\n\nTransit-oriented development (TOD) is a strategy of building homes at or near public transportation stops and stations. In the United States, this strategy has had a complicated record—often leading to increased property values while simultaneously lowering household travel costs and reducing reliance on personal vehicles.[@lund2006] TOD often raises concerns about the displacement of low-income residents and small businesses, leading some local and regional governments to include affordability requirements in their TOD programs.[@dawkins2016]\n\nWhile these concerns are valid, there is not an obvious, better alternative to TOD. Sharp increases in sprawling, low-density residential and commercial development in Washington during 1980s resulted in many unintended consequences, including ecological disruption, traffic congestion, urban disinvestment, and loss of agricultural lands. This led the Washington State Legislature to adopt the Growth Management Act (GMA), a law requiring cities and counties to plan to accommodate growth within designated areas (urban growth areas or UGAs).[@trohimovich2002] Many of the GMA's goals are highly aligned with TOD—particularly the first four goals of the law.[^3]\n\n[^3]: The first four goals of [*RCW 36.70A.020 Planning goals*](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=36.70a.020) are:\n\n    > \\(1\\) Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner. (2) Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development. (3) Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and per capita vehicle miles traveled, and are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans. (4) Housing. Plan for and accommodate housing affordable to all economic segments of the population of this state, promote a variety of residential densities and housing types, and encourage preservation of existing housing stock.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Results\n\n## Discussion\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
