abstract: |
  During the 2024 legislative session in Washington State, two bills were introduced in both the House and the Senate aimed at promoting community and transit-oriented housing development. These bills, HB 2160 and SB 6024, propose mandating cities to permit developments of a specific scale within certain distances from high-capacity transit stops. This study evaluates the extent to which the proposed increases in development capacity under these bills exceed current allowances. The findings indicate a substantial enhancement in development potential for the majority of areas within walking distance of transit stops. Specifically, for land that is developable and presently zoned for lower development capacity than what the bills propose, the average increase in capacity is projected to be +1.35 in terms of floor area ratio (FAR).
 
plain-language-summary: |
  In 2024, the Washington State Legislature considered two new laws aimed at making it easier to build homes near public transit areas, like light rail stations and bus rapid transit stops. These laws would require cities to allow taller, denser buildings in these areas. Our study looked at how much more development could happen under these new laws compared to what's currently allowed. We found that, if these laws pass, there would be a lot more room for building new homes and apartments near transit stops.

## Introduction

```{r}
eruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)
n_eruptions <- length(eruptions)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma
#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.
#| fig-height: 1.5
#| fig-width: 6
par(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)
plot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), 
  pch = "|", axes = FALSE)
axis(1)
box()
```

```{r}
#| output: false
avg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))
avg_years_between_eruptions
```

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `r round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
